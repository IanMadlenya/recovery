    and keep the compiled, human-readable JavaScript in the `js` directory.      
    Since it contains our comments and formatting, we strongly recommend looking

    <!-- <div id="story">
        The US housing market has been an area of intense interest in recent years. Real estate plays an integral role in the US economy, representing a significant source of income for some and a significant investment for others. Residential real estate provides housing for individuals and their families, and often represents a family’s most significant investment. Commercial real estate provides space for offices, factories, and apartment buildings. 

        In the last several years, the conversation on the US housing market has focused on its recovery from the 2008 crisis. Nationwide housing trends are widely discussed in the news, and reports detailing local trends in locations such as Manhattan, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and more recently [Williston, North Dakota](http://time.com/8731/highest-rent-in-us-williston-north-dakota/), are common. However, these discussions often rely on a couple of raw statistics and rudimentary visualizations, and as such struggle to communicate effectively with readers. We wanted to help fill this gap by producing a collection of clean, useful, and insightful visualizations which could be used as interactive tools for exploring trends in the US housing market.
        
        This screencast below accompanies this visualization.
