## Design studio feedback ##

Feedback from Ina Chen and Manny "Fox" Morone

make national line white or orange (warm color) or navy
    make county line orange
differentiate missing data and states that aren't in a bucket
have actual number on tooltip
text on slider
we're not going to go for any optional features - not meaningful, no one thinks of country as zip-codes

add buffer to line graph scale
show number of counties that are highlighted
more instructions
    tooltips?
