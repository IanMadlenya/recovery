This repository contains the code and data used to create a collection of clean, useful, and insightful visualizations which can be used as interactive tools for exploring trends in the US housing market.

The `data` directory contains a collection of CSV files downloaded from [Zillow Real Estate Research](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/).

As you might expect, the `code` directory contains our project code. Within `code`, the `coffee` directory contains our [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) code, the `js` directory contains compiled, human-readable JavaScript, and the `css` directory contains our custom styling.
